Here I have compiled a list of 10 thoughts that will navigate you through your dive deep into the human consciousness. *(Don’t forget to come back for comment though!)*

##### 10. Nothing in the world is harder than speaking the truth and nothing easier than flattery.

This was true when there were powerful political kings in the world, and it is true today with our powerful corporate princesses.

When we are going after something in full intensity and desire, those  speed bumps are annoying which halt us to remind us — what we’re  pursuing is perverse. For a person who wants things from us, it is  surely healthier to tell us how well we drive than show us what we’ve  ignored!

##### 9. Lack of originality, everywhere, all over the world, from time immemorial,  has always been considered the foremost quality and the recommendation  of the active, efficient and practical man…

To be original, you have to see deep.

To see deep, you have to go slow.

If you are slow, the world will seem faster.

The world seems faster because it moves faster.

It moves faster because it isn’t concerned about originality. It merely wants to ‘make-it’

The ones who ‘make-it’ fast are **active, efficient, and practical!**

##### 8. A fool with a heart and no sense is just as unhappy as a fool with sense and no heart.

A person who is at all times deeply immersed in feelings doesn’t have control over things.

A person who is at all times in control of things, doesn’t have time for feelings.

Both are fools and unhappy!

##### 7. Inventors and geniuses have almost always been looked on as no better than fools  at the beginning of their career, and very frequently at the end of it  also.

True inventors and geniuses are original thinkers. And:

> To be original, you have to see deep.
>
> To see deep, you have to go slow.

(Just as in Quote No9)

It’s apparent that if you see deeper than others, you will be called a fool, for they cannot even imagine what you are able to see.

It’s also apparent that if go slower than others, you will be called a fool. For others have started running while you are still crawling in  your diapers.

BUT,

**What about the end?**

**DID you get it? Please give your perspective in the Comments.**

##### 6. Above all, avoid falsehood, every kind of falsehood, especially falseness to  yourself. Watch over your own deceitfulness and look into it every hour, every minute.

It’s hard to listen to adverse things about ourselves. It’s almost impossible to admit them!

It’s easy to say adverse things about others. It’s almost easiest to consider it to be true.

**First, stop lying to yourself. Stop lying to  yourself that this Dostoevsky quote compilation you are doing on Medium  is not for views, reads, email subscribers and money.**

Tell yourself loud and clear: I also need money in life. I need it  through my writing. Don’t hide behind fancy make-believes. Admit the  truth to yourself. Don’t live in delusion.

Look at yourself on your front camera each night: Count how many people  you deceived that day. Look at yourself in your front camera each  morning: Say you will try to decrease at least one deception this day.

##### 5. In most cases, people, even the most vicious, are much more naive and  simple-minded than we assume them to be. And this is true of ourselves too.

This is where Dostoevsky’s genius truly shines.

In moments of both excitement and disappointment, we tend to exaggerate a lot. When our personal heroes manage to satisfy our demands, we run out of positive adjectives to describe them. **When  someone becomes an opposite force pushing us further from where we  desired to be, we run out of derogatory adjectives to describe that  person.**

And the same applies to our self-judgment. We, humans, are simple if we  understand the basics. There are a few laws. We need to understand them.

##### 4. To be in love is not the same as loving. You can be in love with a woman and still hate her.

Being in love is a feeling while loving is a temporary attitude. The  former is romantic in nature while the latter could mean sympathy, pity, and even awe.

The opposite of being in love is *loathe*. The opposite of loving is hating.

You can be in love with a person, and still hate that person’s behavior, character, and actions.

##### 3. Above all, do not lie to yourself. A man who lies to himself and listens to  his own lie comes to a point where he does not discern any truth either  in himself or anywhere around him, and thus falls into disrespect  towards himself and others.

If you lie so much that you begin lying to yourself too, you become a  chronic-liar. It will lead to you losing both the ability and the will  to look at things truly.

You will start deceiving yourself. All you will try to do is convince  yourself and others that your point-of-view is the only truth and the  only real way of looking at things. **That is, you lie and falsify everything to both advance and defend your perspective and actions.** You will not only spit lies but also swallow them.

And what will all this lead to?

You lose the respect of others and therefore of yourself.

You lose the respect of others because they can see through you. They  can see that you are unoriginal, unworthy and self-deceiving. And hence, they decode your game. It doesn’t matter to them if they are the same.  We all like to spit on others, remember?

And once we perceive ourselves being disrespected by others — it’s impossible for us to respect ourselves.

##### 2. For there are two sorts of mind: one that matters, and one that doesn’t matter.

One type of mind is that — which understands and pursues things of value and truth. The other type of mind doesn’t care about that stuff. It  pursues things of advantage.

We all have these two categories of minds within us. We have both the  impulse to pursue value and truth, and also things of advantage.

The mind which pursues truth is the one that matters. The other doesn’t!

##### 1. Talking nonsense is man’s only privilege that distinguishes him from all other organisms.
