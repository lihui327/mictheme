Have you ever tried to pick your next read and felt overwhelmed by the sheer number of choices?

With approximately 130 million books in the world and more and more coming  out every day, it is increasingly difficult to decide what to read next. While some people read habitually and for pleasure, there are others  who might not be inclined so and want to read for its benefits, or to  inculcate reading habit, and not know where to start.

As an avid reader since childhood, here are my picks for TOP 15 books that you MUST read — even if you are not into reading.

The list is in **increasing order of difficulty**, based on the topic, language and length, and is a fair mix of fiction and non-fiction.

##### 1. Animal Farm by George Orwell

Animal Farm is a deceptively simple story of pigs, goats, sheep, cows,  puppies, hens and humans, a fairy tale of sorts. This novella is a poignant comment on the cycle of society, where an oppressor is overthrown only  to be replaced by another oppressor. According to Orwell, the fable  reflects events leading up to the Russian Revolution of 1917 and then on into the Stalinist era of the Soviet Union.

##### 2. Tuesdays with Morrie by Mitch Albom

Another simple and beautiful read throwing light on love, life, loss and death. Tuesdays With Morrie presents a valuable reminder that “once you learn to die, you learn to live”. Filled with innumerable gems of  wisdom, this is must-read for people of all ages.

##### 3. To Kill A Mocking Bird by Harper Lee

A classic of modern American literature, this Pulitzer Prize winning  novel is painfully innocent and refreshingly honest. Set in the small  Southern town of Maycomb, Alabama, To Kill A Mocking Bird presents the  views of a child on race and justice.

##### 4. The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas

The quintessential Black Lives Matter book, The Hate U Give by Angie  Thomas sheds light on the reality of how the society systematically  represses a race. Written with immense vulnerability and honesty, this  book is extremely emotional and thought-provoking.

##### 5. The Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini

A heartbreakingly beautiful and intimate story of friendship, devotion,  regret and redemption, this one is a book that will stay with you  forever. Set against the backdrop of the history of Afghanistan, this  debut novel by Khaled Hosseini is highly emotional and beautifully  crafted. I dare you to not cry reading this one!

##### 6. Wild: Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail by Cheryl Strayed

Raw, emotional and brutally honest account of loss and grief, spiraling  down and finding oneself through travel, Wild by Cheryl Strayed is a  highly enjoyable and enlightening read.

##### 7. Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen

Pride and Prejudice is a well-renowned historical romance, a classic,  but it is so much more than that! Read this one for glorious characters, vastly ahead of its time feminism and highly enjoyable and witty  dialogues.

##### 8. Little Women by Louisa May Alcott

A beautiful and heart-warming tale of the March sisters, Little Women is a classic, loved by young and old alike. It explores timeless themes of love and death, war and peace, the conflict between personal ambition  and family responsibilities, and the clash of cultures between Europe  and America.

##### 9. 1984 by George Orwell

Another gem by Orwell, 1984 is the indisputable king of dystopia. A  highly disturbing and mind-shattering novel, this is a must-read to push your mind’s horizons. This one will surely change the way you look at  things.

##### 10. The Diary of a Young Girl by Anne Frank

Originally published in Dutch in 1946, The Diary of a Young Girl is the  actual diary kept by Anne Frank while she was in hiding for two years  with her family during the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands. While  Anne herself succumbed to typhus in a concentration camp, her words  lived on through this book published by her father. It is a first hand  account of the horrors of WW2 and a must read for everyone.

##### 11. Brave New World by Aldous Huxley

Brave New World is a first-rate dystopian novel and represents with  horrifying clarity the conclusion our society is plausibly headed  towards. Though somewhat poorly written, the sheer brilliance of its  concept makes it intellectually stimulating and a must-read. It is a  highly controversial read and has been banned by several countries in  the past for multitude of reasons.

##### 12. The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg

In this enlightening and fascinating book, Charles Duhigg unravels the  mysteries of brain — how we form habits, and how these habits control  our lives, and more importantly, how can we use this knowledge to reform the undesirable habits and replace them with new ones.

##### 13. Gone with the Wind by Margaret Mitchell

An epic saga of love and war, Gone with the Wind by Margaret Mitchell is a masterpiece of literature — unforgettable characters, beautiful  prose, and a story that will have you totally engrossed. Another  Pulitzer Prize winning novel, it is a 1000+ page novel, but every page  is worth reading.

##### 14. Outliers: The Story of Success by Malcolm Gladwell

Malcolm Gladwell has the gift of looking at things from a different  angle. An intellectually stimulating and eye-opening read, Outliers is  one of the best behavioral psychology book to read — highly engaging,  thoroughly researched and truly mind-blowing.

If you read one science book during your lifetime, make it this one. In  this one, Bill Bryson quite literally presents a history of nearly  everything — universe, solar system, planet, human race, and that too in a highly engaging and hilarious manner. A must read for everyone,  irrespective of educational backgrounds.
